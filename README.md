#Installation and usage

There are two ways to use this program. 

This program should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux, although it has only been tested on Windows. First install [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/). Then download this repository to any location on your computer and run the FFL2MonsterEvo.py script. Linux installations may also require separate installations of Tkinter and Tcl/Tk---see [here](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter).

Alternatively if you are on 64-bit Windows, just download and run FFL2MonsterEvo.exe, available [here](https://github.com/CodeMartyLikeYou/FFL2-Monster-Evolution-Path-Calculator/releases).
